## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Visual Studio Code 1.75.0 or higher
- Rust toolchain (rustc, cargo)
- [summer-lsp](https://github.com/summer-rs/summer-lsp) language server (optional, bundled with extension)

### From VS Code Marketplace

1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X / Cmd+Shift+X)
3. Search for "Summer RS"
4. Click Install

### From VSIX

1. Download the latest `.vsix` file from [Releases](https://github.com/summer-rs/summer-lsp/releases)
2. Open VS Code
3. Go to Extensions
4. Click "..." menu → "Install from VSIX..."
5. Select the downloaded file

## Getting Started

### 1. Create a summer-rs Project

```bash
cargo new my-summer-app
cd my-summer-app
```

Add summer-rs to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
summer = "0.1"
summer-web = "0.1"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

### 2. Create Configuration

Create `config/app.toml`:

```toml
[web]
host = "0.0.0.0"
port = 8080
```

### 3. Write Your Application

```rust
use summer::App;
use summer_web::{get, WebPlugin};
use summer_web::axum::response::IntoResponse;

#[get("/")]
async fn hello() -> impl IntoResponse {
    "Hello, Summer RS!"
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    App::new()
        .add_plugin(WebPlugin)
        .run()
        .await
}
```

### 4. Use the Extension

1. Open your project in VS Code
2. The extension will automatically detect your summer-rs application
3. Click the Summer RS icon in the Activity Bar
4. Click the ▶️ (Run) button next to your app
5. Once running, explore Components, Routes, and other views

## Configuration

### Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

- `summer-rs.serverPath`: Path to summer-lsp executable (leave empty to use bundled version)
- `summer-rs.openWith`: Browser to use when opening apps (`integrated` or `external`)
- `summer-rs.openUrl`: URL template for opening apps (default: `http://localhost:{port}{contextPath}`)
- `summer-rs.enableGutter`: Show gutter icons in editors (`on` or `off`)
- `summer-rs.env`: Environment variables to set when running apps
- `summer-rs.trace.server`: Trace LSP communication (`off`, `messages`, or `verbose`)

### Example Configuration

```json
{
  "summer-rs.openWith": "external",
  "summer-rs.env": {
    "RUST_LOG": "debug",
    "DATABASE_URL": "postgres://localhost/mydb"
  },
  "summer-rs.trace.server": "messages"
}
```

## Usage

### Running Applications

**Single Application:**
- Click the ▶️ (Run) button in the Apps view

## Troubleshooting

### Language Server Not Starting

**Problem:** Extension shows "Language server failed to start"

**Solutions:**
1. Check if `summer-lsp` is installed:
   ```bash
   summer-lsp --version
   ```

2. Specify the path manually:
   ```json
   {
     "summer-rs.serverPath": "/path/to/summer-lsp"
   }
   ```

3. Install from source:
   ```bash
   cargo install summer-lsp
   ```

### Application Not Detected

**Problem:** Your summer-rs app doesn't appear in the Apps view

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure `Cargo.toml` includes summer-rs dependencies:
   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   summer = "0.1"
   ```

2. Ensure your crate is a binary (has `src/main.rs` or `[[bin]]` section)

3. Click the refresh button in the Apps view

4. Check the Output panel (View → Output → Summer RS) for errors

### Port Detection Issues

**Problem:** Extension can't detect the application port

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure `config/app.toml` has the port configured:
   ```toml
   [web]
   port = 8080
   ```

2. The extension will use port 8080 by default if not configured

### Components/Routes Not Showing

**Problem:** Views are empty even though the app is running

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure the language server is running (check Output panel)

2. Wait a few seconds for the app to fully start

3. Click the refresh button in the view

4. Check if the app is actually running (look for the green icon)

## Known Issues
